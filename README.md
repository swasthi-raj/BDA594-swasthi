# My Definition of Big Data
Big Data is considered to be the huge amount of data collected from different sources, which could not be easily handled with the traditional tools like excel. These data can be both structured or unstructured, where we need to use advanced technological tools to dissect the data, process and put it in an informative way. The size of data to be considered as Big Data keeps changing every 5 years or it could be shorter. Big data analysis is very significant, without which there is no artificial intelligence. It is very much needed for all kinds of industry, people and places.
